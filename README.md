Player Bob is dealt two Cards, and dealer's score is hidden:

Bob busts during the first hit, so the dealer's turn was skipped:

Technologies used: 
    -Javascript
    -HTML
    -CSS


Planned future enhancements (icebox items):
    - add sound
    - animations, give it some dimension
    - add money/coins to the game
    - functionality for adding more players which would require a lot of refactoring


Project Difficulties:
Starting was the hardest part. I think apart of that was due to not having successfully used DOM retrieval or manipulation in VS Code. I was also jumping around alot which ended up hurting me. It's best to start at the begining and handle things in order, test, and make sure everything works as it should.
