# PROJECT 1! **Browser-based Game**

## **Overview**

Your first SEI project will start out with something fun - **a game!**

Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how to **think like a programmer**!

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**. You got your feet wet with Tic-Tac-Toe, and we built a game or two during class - now it's time to step it up a notch.

**You will be working individually for this project**. However, your instructors and instructor assistants will be guiding you along with up to ten 15-minute one-on-one sessions. Be sure to use them wisely :).

As a reminder, GA has a zero plagiarism policy - your project's code **must be substantially yours**. **Do not copy code from other similar projects or other sources**. However, using lines of code from StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string.

## **Planning & Presentation Requirements**

### **Planning - Due By BOD August 8, 2022**

- You will share:
    
    ☐ Your choice of game.
    
    ☐ A wireframe of your "main" game screen. (Many students find [https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/) helpful)
    
    ☐ Pseudocode for the overall gameplay. 1. deck shuffled , 2 players game play + game outcomes 

### **Presentation - Friday, August 12th:**

You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**
    
    ☐ Intro your game by paraphrasing the README.
    
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**
    
    ☐ Launch the game by clicking the link in the README.
    
    ☐ Play the game! If necessary, manipulate the values of variables in the console to ensure a quick win or loss.
    
3. **Show/discuss your code:**
    
    ☐ Briefly show the HTML & CSS.
    
    ☐ Show the JavaScript and discuss your favorite function.
    
4. **Share the experience:**
    
    ☐ What was your biggest challenge?
    
    ☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
    
5. **Q & A + Feedback**

---

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Your App Must:**

☐ **Render a game in the browser**.

☐ **Include win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining **dead and/or commented out code** (code that will never be called).

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs, and variables (data) are named as nouns.

☐ **Be coded in a consistent** manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## **Necessary Deliverables**

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages** (covered next week).

- **A `README.md` file** with these sections:
    
    ☐ **<Your game's title>**: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.
    
    ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.
    
    ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
    
    ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.
    
    ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
    
    > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well-crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
    > 

☐ **Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project**. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board". **Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public".**

## **Choose From the Following Games**

> Note: Games are listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty.
> 
0. **Tamagotchi**
1. **Trivia game**
2. **War** (the card game)
3. **Blackjack**
4. **Slot Machine**
5. **Simon** (warning: will require asynchronous timing)
6. **2048**
7. **Minesweeper**
8. **Checkers** (no AI required - player vs. player is fine)
9. **Solitaire**
10. **Battleship** (would require a little AI to implement a computer opponent)

**If you have a game not on the list that you'd like to code, please be sure to get approval from your instructor!**

> *IMPORTANT: Because it's important to demonstrate your ability to perform DOM manipulation using JavaScript, all games should be DOM-based, **not canvas-based**.*

## **Suggestions**

- **The BEST advice is to follow the guidelines and principles in the** [Guide to Building a Browser App](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/6f1919291f6007b2c0b2c93d925d6bac). The guide will give you a step-by-step process to get you started and its MVC design pattern will result in clearer, more concise code that can scale functionality more easily.
- **Theme your game** to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, DevTools' debugger, `alert` statements) to debug and solve issues.
- Stick with the **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** principle. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.
- If you choose a card-based game, there is a CSS library in the *resources* directory of the class repo that will help you render **beautiful** cards of any size, front and back.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation and other resources** to better understand methods, etc.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.

## **Project Feedback + Evaluation**

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If your instructors determine that your project does not meet the above requirements (denoted using checkboxes), you will be given 3 calendar days to address the deficiencies identified. However, be aware that **there is only a single opportunity to resubmit a project during the course**. For example, if you have to resubmit Project 1, you will not have an opportunity to resubmit Projects 2, 3, or 4.
- Immediately after your presentation, your instructor and/or outcomes may provide you with feedback that will benefit your project and perhaps the projects of other students as well.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback on, please ask!
