How Do You Find a Hand’s Total Value?
Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.

TEST

GAME PLAY
<!-- AI -->
- deal 2 cards for theirselves and two for the player
    - back & forth, AI has one card hidden
- AI asks player if they want to hit or stand
    - Hit: AI deals player 1 more card
        - AI turns over second card
            - game analyzed on who wins or loses
                - if player wins, player collects pot and then decides if they want to play another round 
                
    - stand: AI turns over second card 
- After round is over, AI asks if you want to play another round

<!-- player moves -->
- hit - until player is satisfied or max is reached 
- stand

<!-- Outcomes of game -->

 - whoever has the highest card count - wins
 - blackjack on first draw- automatic wins
 - blackjack - wins
 - push (no one wins), e.g. dealer = player = 20 points
 - bust - player goes over 21
 - bust - AI goes over 21 - no one wins


 
 - AI wins because cards are 21 points - 
- ****AI needs to hit until they have over 17 points: If AI has <=16 points, they hit until they bust, blackjack, 
    - if bust, AI loses
