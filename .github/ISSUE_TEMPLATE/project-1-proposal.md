My chosen game is Blackjack. Features single player vs AI/dealer. No betting allowed! :)

### Basic User stories 
90's style, "solitaire-vibe" blackjack game. Features single player vs computer. One deck of cards is dealt at a time. At end, you're asked if you want to quit or play another game. No betting is allowed. This is kid-friendly.
